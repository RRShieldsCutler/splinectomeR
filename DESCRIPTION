Description: This package contains several statistical analysis tools
    developed to aid in analyzing longitudinal data that may be noisy,
    missing datapoints, unbalanced, etc. As the name implies, the functions
    use smoothing splines to make comparisons to a null hypothesis, usually by
    permuting the relevant features to generate a random distribution against
    which to test the true measured values (your data). With these tools, you
    can compare between groups overall, between groups across a continuous
    variable, or for a non-zero change in a single population. For
    example, if you were testing the level of cortisol in patients given
    a drug or placebo, this package would allow you to test whether there is
    an overall significant difference between the groups' cortisol response, 
    whether there are differences between the groups at some time intervals but
    not others, and whether there is a non-zero change in the response of the
    drug group over time.
